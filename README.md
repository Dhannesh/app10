Implementing Stacks, Lists and Grids in Flutter

## Getting Started
The stack, list, and grid layouts are very popular in mobile applications because they make great use of screen real estate and allow us to represent information in a manner that is easy for users to understand and parse. In app, we will learn to use the Stack widget to layer widgets one on top of another. we will use relative and positioned widgets as a part of the stack and see that positioned widgets give us very fine-grained control over where a widget is placed. 

Next, we will represent elements using the ListView. we will configure the properties of the ListView to match our use case and use the ListTile and the Card widgets to build list elements. We will also build list views with an infinite number of elements. Finally, we will represent our app elements using the GridView.
